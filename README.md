# Road Safety Data Analysis (Power BI)

## Problem Statement

This project involves developing a Power BI dashboard for road safety data. From the dataset you are expected to review existing accident data, identify data gaps, conduct data cleaning, and develop visualization of the data in Power BI. This dataset was provided by Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore in their coding round of research internship at Cistup.

### Note : You can also take a look of the interactive dashboard by downloading the dataset providing in this repository and uploading .pbit file on the Power BI desktop app. Just ensure you have uploaded dataset on the Power BI.

## Solution Provided

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides comprehensive insights into road safety trends, facilitating informed decision-making and proactive measures to enhance public safety. It helps the government to know in which areas accident are frequent. Through different type of graphs and visualizations, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can take neccessary steps by identifying the aciident prone areas. We have made the dashboard dynamic by introducing quarter options and area wise detailed graphs.
Used: <br>
1)Stacked bar charts <br>
2)Slicer (for selection of quarters and a particular area) <br>
3)Pie chart <br>
4)Summary of Total casualties and average speed limit <br>
5)Clustered charts
